- **Purpose**: Onboarding page with AuthGuard integration
- **Features**: Redirects to /translate after completion

### 5. Route Updates

- **File**: `app/page.tsx` (MODIFIED)
- **Changes**: Now acts as a smart router:

  - Unauthenticated → /auth
  - Onboarding incomplete → /onboarding
  - Profile setup incomplete → /profile-setup
  - **Default**: → /translate (replaces dashboard)

- **File**: `app/dashboard/page.tsx` (NEW)

- **Changes**:
  - Added `requireOnboarding` prop (default true)
  - Updated redirect logic to check onboarding status before profile setup
  - Onboarding check happens after authentication but before profile setup

### 7. Navigation Updates

- **Changes**: Dashboard link now points to /dashboard instead of /

### 8. Seed Data Updates

- **File**: `prisma/seed.ts`
- **Changes**: Demo user now has `onboardingCompleted: true` for testing

## User Flow

### New Users (First Time)

1. Register/Login → Redirects to /onboarding
2. Complete onboarding → Redirects to /translate
3. Profile setup (if needed) → Redirects to /translate
4. **Translate page is now the default experience**

### Existing Users

- Existing users with onboarding = false will see onboarding flow on next login
- After completing, they're taken to translate page
- Dashboard is accessible via /dashboard

### Skip Onboarding

- Users can click "Skip onboarding" to bypass the flow
- Will still be taken to translate page

## API Endpoints

### Complete Onboarding

- **Endpoint**: `/api/auth/complete-onboarding`
- **Method**: POST
- **Headers**:
  - `Content-Type: application/json`
  - `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "message": "Onboarding completed successfully"
  }
  ```

## Key Features

1. **Progressive Onboarding**: Users see step-by-step introduction to platform features
2. **Visual Progress**: Step indicators show progress through onboarding
3. **Skip Option**: Users can skip if they're familiar with the platform
4. **Automatic Redirects**: Smart routing based on completion status
5. **Non-blocking**: Translate page doesn't require onboarding
6. **State Management**: Onboarding status is stored in database and synced to client

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] New user registration triggers onboarding
- [ ] Existing user without onboarding sees flow
- [ ] Skip button works correctly
- [ ] Completion updates database
- [ ] Redirect to /translate after completion
- [ ] Dashboard accessible at /dashboard
- [ ] All existing features still work

## Deployment Notes

1. Run database migration on production:

   ```bash
   npx prisma db push
   ```

2. Existing users will have `onboardingCompleted: false` by default
3. They'll see onboarding on next login
4. Demo user has onboarding completed for testing

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

1. Set `onboardingCompleted: true` for all users via SQL
2. Revert route changes in navigation
3. Keep dashboard as default page
